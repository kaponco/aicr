# UAT Day/Night Cycle and Reservation Broker

**AICR's real-hardware UAT runs on a small set of reserved GPU pools that must be time-shared.** The day/night broker (issue #1274) arbitrates that scarce capacity so contending runs *queue* instead of racing the hardware, driven entirely by a checked-in registry. This page explains the operating model, how to request a run, how queuing behaves, and how to add a reservation.

## The day/night cycle

Each reserved GPU pool follows a daily cycle, with every phase acquiring the *same* per-reservation lease so CI and human use never overlap on one reservation:

- **Night — the nightly batch.** On a cron, `uat-nightly-batch.yaml` runs the [version matrix](#the-version-matrix) per reservation — `main` plus the previous N stable releases — each cell a full provision → CUJ → evidence → publish → teardown.
- **Morning — handoff.** Once the batch drains a reservation, the daytime human-access deployment is stood up on it (owned by DC2/DC8; not yet implemented).
- **Day — human use.** The daytime cluster is used outside CI.
- **Evening — teardown.** The daytime cluster is torn down before the next night batch.

The phases are independently scheduled (cron edges), not chained: the per-reservation lease — plus a pre-batch guard (DC2) — keeps them from overlapping, so a crashed or overrunning phase never orphans the reservation. A hosted GitHub Actions job is capped at the runner's timeout (hours, not a whole working day), so a single lease-holding run cannot span the day; the lease only needs to cover the brief transition windows, and the steady-state daytime cluster's existence is guarded by its lease-tag rather than a continuously held run.

> The morning handoff, the daytime deployment, and the evening teardown are owned by sibling work (DC2 and DC8) and are not yet wired up. What ships today is the **night side** (the nightly batch) plus the **lease + dispatch surface** every phase builds on.

## Requesting a UAT run

All UAT runs go through one entry point, `uat-run.yaml` — the shared dispatch surface that owns the reservation lease. To request a run, dispatch it with a reservation name from the registry:

```bash
gh workflow run uat-run.yaml --repo NVIDIA/aicr --ref main -f reservation=aws-h100
```

`uat-run.yaml` resolves the reservation row, then invokes the cloud-appropriate reusable pipeline (`uat-aws.yaml` or `uat-gcp.yaml`). A typo'd reservation name fails fast in the resolve step (the `uat-broker` helper exits *not found*). For manual debugging, `skip_tests` and `skip_delete` inputs are available.

The nightly batch and (later) the daytime handoff call this *same* surface, so every run for a reservation contends on one lease.

## How queuing works (the reservation lease)

The lease is a GitHub Actions concurrency group keyed by reservation name — `uat-<reservation>` (for example `uat-aws-h100`) — declared on `uat-run.yaml` with `cancel-in-progress: false`. Two runs that target the *same* reservation serialize: the second waits until the first (including its teardown) finishes. Two runs that target *different* reservations share no group and run in parallel, because they are independent hardware.

This replaces the previous behavior, where a second run hitting a busy AWS reservation hard-failed on the capacity check. Now it queues.

**The one-in-progress-plus-one-pending limit.** GitHub concurrency holds at most one in-progress run plus one pending run per group. If a *third* run is queued for a reservation that already has one in-progress and one pending, GitHub cancels the older pending run and the newest takes its place. At launch this is acceptable: there are two reservations, each contended by at most the nightly cron plus an occasional ad-hoc dispatch. A run cancelled this way is *superseded*, not failed. So that a dropped request is never silent, the `uat-superseded-notice.yaml` observer watches for it: triggered on `workflow_run: completed` for `UAT Run`, it classifies a cancelled run that never started a job as a supersede (versus a genuine mid-run cancel) and emits a job-summary entry plus a `::warning`. (The nightly controller reconciles the same signal synchronously for the cells it dispatches; a DC6 regression guard, #1279, will exercise the observer.) If deeper queuing is ever needed (many requesters per reservation), the escalation path is the *Deferred* standing broker service — a pull-based queue rather than GitHub concurrency — recorded in the epic (#1264).

## The version matrix

The nightly batch runs a **cross-version regression** per reservation: `main` (built from source at tip) plus the previous **N** stable releases, so an older stable `aicr` is re-checked against today's cluster. `uat-broker schedule` orders the cells `main`-first, then releases in descending semver order; the controller runs them **sequentially** on the reservation (each cell dispatched through `uat-run.yaml`, so they share the lease) and **time-boxes** the batch — once the deadline passes it stops dispatching, so the in-flight cell finishes and the remaining (oldest) releases are dropped, guaranteeing `main` and the freshest releases always land.

**Release cells install released artifacts, not source.** A `main` cell builds the `aicr` binary + validator/agent images from the checked-out tree. A release cell (`aicr_version=vX.Y.Z`) instead downloads the released `aicr` binary at that tag; the released binary self-resolves its own version's validator images (`…/aicr-validators/<phase>:vX.Y.Z`) and snapshot agent (`ghcr.io/nvidia/aicr:vX.Y.Z`), so no images are built for release cells. Each run's summary records its `aicr_version` (`main` or the tag).

**Release cells verify what they install.** The `install-aicr-release` composite action does two checks before a downloaded binary is used, and **fails closed** on either: (1) *integrity* — the archive matches its `aicr_checksums.txt` entry; and (2) *provenance* — `cosign verify-blob-attestation` validates the SLSA Build Provenance v1 attestation goreleaser ships inside the archive (`aicr-attestation.sigstore.json`). The verifier does not trust *any* NVIDIA release signer: it derives the certificate-identity regexp from the requested `aicr_version`, so **only the attestation for that exact release tag** is accepted (`on-tag.yaml@refs/tags/<that-version>`, issuer `token.actions.githubusercontent.com`) — an attestation for a different tag is rejected. The attestation's subject is the binary's own digest, so this also binds authenticity to the exact bytes that run — not to the same-release checksums manifest. A release whose binary is unattested, or whose attestation does not verify, aborts the cell rather than running an unverified `aicr`.

**Tunables** — workflow inputs on `uat-nightly-batch.yaml` (these are the scheduled-run defaults):

- `previous_n` — stable releases below `main` to run per reservation (default `2`; `0` = `main` only).
- `deadline_offset_hours` — hours after batch start to stop dispatching new cells (default `5`). The controller job watches each cell sequentially and GitHub caps a hosted job at 6h, so this stays below that ceiling (and the job's own `timeout-minutes`) to keep the graceful drop-oldest reachable rather than being killed mid-cell.

To test a single released version by hand: `gh workflow run uat-run.yaml --repo NVIDIA/aicr --ref main -f reservation=aws-h100 -f aicr_version=v1.2.3`. (`--ref main` dispatches the nightly-path revision of the workflow, not your feature branch's.)

## Adding a reservation

Reservations are data, not code. To onboard a new reserved pool, add a row to `infra/uat/reservations.yaml`:

```yaml
- name: aws-b200          # the lease key; becomes concurrency group uat-aws-b200
  cloud: aws              # aws | gcp — selects which pipeline (EKS vs GKE) provisions
  reservation-id: cr-...  # the cloud capacity-reservation id (GCP uses the full path)
  accelerator: b200
  gpu-count: 8
  cluster-config-path: tests/uat/aws/cluster-config-b200.yaml
  test-config-dir: tests/uat/aws/tests
```

No broker, workflow, or Go change is needed — the nightly batch enumerates rows from the registry, and `uat-run.yaml` resolves them. The unit of sequencing is the *reservation*, so a new GPU type in an existing cloud simply runs in parallel with the others on its own lease. (Provisioning is per *cloud*: the same `uat-aws.yaml` pipeline provisions any AWS accelerator from the row's `cluster-config-path`; you do not add a per-accelerator workflow.)

The values in this file are identifiers, **not secrets** — a reservation-id grants no access on its own; access to the reserved capacity is governed by cloud IAM/ACLs bound to the CI federation identity (see `infra/uat-aws-account/` and `infra/uat-gcp-account/`). They are safe to commit.

## Roadmap

What ships now is the lease, the data-driven dispatch surface, the time-boxed nightly version matrix (`main` + previous-N stable releases, release cells installing released artifacts), and superseded-run surfacing (the controller flags a dropped cell inline; the `uat-superseded-notice.yaml` observer catches ad-hoc dropped runs). Still to come:

- **Per-intent shaping + daytime deployment (DC2 / DC8).** Selecting the test config and recipe by `intent`, and the morning-handoff daytime human-access cluster.
